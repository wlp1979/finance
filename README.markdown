Finance Director
============================================================================================================

Finance Director is a web application built using the Zend Framework.  The application provides the user 
a way to plan their budget in a very granular system.  The idea is that each pay-check during the month 
should be allocated to fund the various expenses you have, and each one should be zeroed out completely.
The Transactions tab gives the user a way to track their spending and assign each transaction to an expense.
You can also upload data to the transactions tab using the OFX format provided by most online banking sites.

Installation instructions can be found in the docs/INSTALL.markdown.
